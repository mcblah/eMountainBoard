## The Full Build
![The Full Build](https://github.com/jake8796/eMountainBoard/blob/main/Images/eMountainBoard.jpg)

I've hit a top speed of 30 MPH(48 KPH) on the board on an asphault road. I recently tested the board and rode about 19 miles on a single charge. I didn't test the board when the batteries were brand new, but it will decrease with the number of charge cycles per the P42A's [datasheet](https://www.imrbatteries.com/content/molicel_p42a.pdf).  
## The Remote
I built a custom remote with parts I had lying around. I ended up buying a remote when I realized the transmitters I bought were too weak for a safe connection. In the remote folder, there are all the CAD and arduino files for the build.
