## The Full Build
![The Full Build](https://github.com/jake8796/eMountainBoard/blob/main/Images/eMountainBoard.jpg)

I've hit top speed of 30 MPH(48 KPH) on the board on an asphault road. When I first got the battery, I rode it for 23 miles on one charge. I haven't tested the board's range since then, but it will decrease with the number of charge cycles per the P42A's datasheet.  
## The Remote
I built a custom remote with parts I had lying around. I ended up buying a remote when I realized the transmitters I bought were too weak for a safe connection. In the remote folder, there are all the CAD and arduino files for the build.
